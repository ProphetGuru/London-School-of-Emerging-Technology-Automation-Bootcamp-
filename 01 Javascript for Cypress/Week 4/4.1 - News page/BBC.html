<h4><strong><p>It has been a matter of weeks since the last Love Island winners were crowned, but it is once again time to open those villa doors.</p></strong>

Series 10 of the ITV2 dating show kicks off on Monday evening and producers will be hoping it proves more popular with viewers than its winter iteration.

<span>Despite the positive reaction</span> to new host Maya Jama, the show recorded lower audiences and less online commentary than previous series.

The opening episode <span> drew 1.2 million viewers, </span> half the audience of the 2022 summer series' first night.</h4>

<h2>Trending on Twitter</h2>

<p>One big change implemented for 2023 was ITV's ban on contestants' social media being run by friends or family while they were on the show.</p>


<p>This policy of leaving accounts dormant was introduced to protect islanders and those close to them from online bullying and abuse.</p>

<p>Pop culture and reality TV writer Nikki Onafuye says the downside is that savvy contestants could no longer capitalise on well-managed accounts to help boost popularity or engagement in the show.</p>

<q><i>"The appeal of Love Island is the talk on Twitter at 21:00 every night,"</q> she told the BBC.</i>

"Not having friends or family handle your social media does hinder you - you'll remember [2022 contestant] Ikenna Ekwonna's cousin was tweeting the funniest things, creating reactive content and trending on Twitter."
